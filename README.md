# WebCell-Web-SpreadSheet
A web SpreadSheet project written in web language(html,css and JavaScript). It can be run completely offline...

About: A completely offline JavaScript-based SpreadSheet program. It has been written with pure(stock) JS. No additional 3rd party API or framework/library has been used. I have commented on every major logic's code block in this program.
A completely offline JavaScript-based SpreadSheet program. It has been written with pure(stock) JS.
No additional 3rd party API or framework/library has been used. I have commented on every major logic in this program.
By default, this program automatically generates A-Z columns and 1-50 rows (1300 cells), but you can change it from inside the code.
It also supports cell reference (eg '=a1+5' here a1 is referencing cell A1  ).
It also supports formulas, I have tried to include all common formulas. So you will find most formulas predefined. But you can also create your own functions/formulas using native JavaScript code. 
In fact, not only formulas but also variables, arrays, objects, and almost anything can be created and used later.
Please give a start to this project♥.
